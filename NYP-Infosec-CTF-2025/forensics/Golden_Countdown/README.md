## Challenge Description

I received this photo taken right as the New Year countdown ended a few years ago. My friend told me that the “real message” is not in the image, but hidden in the details of the file.

Can you find it?

## Solve

Go to metadata2go.com to check metadata of images and insert ugly_frog1.gif

The "artist" section in the metadata reveals the flag:

![metadata-results](screenshots/screenshot1.png)

The flag is: NYP{TH15_15_4_J0Jo_R3F3ReNCE}
