## Hints
- Can’t find the flag fragments in the redirect pages? Look closely — something in their content doesn’t quite belong. It may need be transformed into something readable

## Challenge Description

Happy New Year! 🎉

I’ve prepared a special New Year gift for you — the flag. But this gift has been split into two fragments and hidden somewhere along a fast sequence of redirects before reaching the final page.

Your browser moves too quickly to display what happens in between, so you may need to inspect the requests occurring during the redirect chain.

Find fragments of the gift, then combine them to reveal the complete gift.

The final page is just a celebration — the real gift is hidden in the redirects before you get there. 🎆

Good luck, and enjoy the hunt!
