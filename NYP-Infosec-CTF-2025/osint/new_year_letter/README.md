## Solve

When loaded into the website, it shows a countdown for New Years.

When scrolled down to the footer, it shows that this website is a Web Daddy project, which gives us a clue on who created this site.

I searched the internet for the company "Web Daddy" and found information about 2 people who work there, PURNELL, Simon and WILSON, James Antony

The flag is: NYP{PURNELL,WILSON}
