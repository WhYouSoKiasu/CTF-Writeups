## Hints
- This is a type of homophonic encryption. If the encrypted word is 2 letters long, the decrypted word is also 2 letters long.
- The flag always starts with 'NYP{' and ends with '}'. You can probably use that to figure out some letters

## Challenge Description

I found this while spring cleaning and remembered that it had some kind of secret on it. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to crack it. Another piece of paper that came with it says that only a letter to number substitution was used, and the same number always corresponds to the same letter. Perhaps you can crack it? The flag is all in lower case, with no spaces
