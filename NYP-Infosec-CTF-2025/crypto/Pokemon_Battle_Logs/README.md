## Challenge Description

During the Poké Cup 2025 finals, a high-intensity battle unfolded between Ash Ketchum and Team Rocket. All battle actions, commands, and system interactions were automatically recorded by the PokéTech Battle Logging System (PBLS). However, referees detected irregular transmissions inside the logs. These logs seem to have been tampered with by Team Rocket to disrupt or manipulate the battle.
