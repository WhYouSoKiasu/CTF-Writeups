Crypto - The Lighthouse signal

The old Portwind Lighthouse has been offline for years. Yet last night, your receiver picked up a strange transmission from its direction.

The log from your radio console shows:
aol zavyt opaz ha tpkupnoa

Beneath it, the system also recorded a line of diagnostic bits:
01010011 01000101 01010110 01000101 01001110
